# PhoneFreedom

## Description
An app that allows users to deal with smartphone addiction, focus and get some time off their phones.

Some of the features are:
- Set a timeout during which all the distracting apps will be blocked.
- Allow users to select the apps the want/ don't want to block.
- Ensure that the user cannot override the timeout, else it would defeat the purpose of a focus app.

## Development environment
- Min SDK version 24
- Target SDK version 29
